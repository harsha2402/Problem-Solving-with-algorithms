    "1. We start by making a undirected graph using adjacency matrix using the existing roads. \n",
    "2. We change it into a weighted undirected graph, by adding weights to the 0 to the existing weights and use the weights of the repairing roads as min cost. \n",
    "3. We use the mininum spanning tree algorithm on the weighted graph. "
